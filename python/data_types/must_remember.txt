Data types:

1. Object and Mutability
- Everything is object in python
- It contains: 
    -- unique identity
    -- unique type
    -- some value and it could be empty also

- Objects can be mutable and immutable based on identity
    -- Mutable is something that is changeable
    -- Immutable is something that is not changeable
    So, mutability and immutability is depend on the reference inside the memory

2. Numbers
- Types of Numbers
    1. Intergers
    2. Boolean
    3. Real numbers => floating point numbers
    4. Complex numbers

3. String
- It has three parts
    -- core part
    -- indexing
    -- slicing

4. Tuples
- Immutable
- represented in () parenthesis

# MUTABLE
5. List
- same as array in other language

6. Set
- We can perform operations like union, intersection, difference,etc on it
- {}
- there is frozenset also there in python which is same as Set

7. Dictionary
- It provides name based indexing
- dict()
- {}
- union, intersection, difference,etc apply to dictionary like Set
